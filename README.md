<h1 align="center">Hello, I'm Mathias Mellemstuen</h1>
I am a dedicated software developer and computer engineer based in Oslo, Norway. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Ã˜stfold University College, where I graduated in May 2022. I recently completed my Master's degree in Computational Science at the University of Oslo.


My current focus lies in programming in general, shader programming, image processing, and machine learning, with a passion for applying these skills to solve complex problems.
